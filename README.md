# Police Information System

Welcome to the Punjab Government's Police Information System, a revolutionary tool designed to automate police records and empower law enforcement with quick access to critical information.

## Features

- **Effortless Data Entry:** Our system simplifies the process of adding complaints, replacing the cumbersome manual methods with a streamlined digital approach.

- **Binary Search:** The Police Information System allows police officers to search for criminal records by name, making it easier to find the information they need rapidly.

- **Crime Type Search:** A comprehensive crime type search function helps officers quickly locate records based on the nature of the crime, enhancing their investigative capabilities.

- **Record Editing:** Officers can easily update and edit criminal records, ensuring that the information is always up-to-date and accurate.

- **Murder Offense List:** The system provides a convenient way to display a list of all criminals with a murder offense, making it a valuable resource for tracking individuals involved in such serious crimes.

- **Recent Crime Tracking:** Police can identify which crimes have occurred in the last month, allowing for a focused approach to monitoring and responding to criminal activities.

- **Record Deletion:** When necessary, officers have the option to delete a criminal record from the system, maintaining data integrity and relevance.

- **Theft Offense List:** The system offers an easy way to view all criminals with a theft offense, aiding in the prevention and investigation of theft-related incidents.

## How it Works

This project centers around a C++ class called "Criminal." It includes a rich set of attributes, such as name, age, race, gender, CNIC, state, city, postal code, address, cell number, date of birth, crime type, offense, punishment in years, crime date, complainer name, investigating officer, and punishment date.

The "Date" class plays a crucial role, with attributes for day, month, and year, ensuring accurate recording of essential dates such as punishment date, date of birth, and crime date.
